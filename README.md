To run, please first install Wolfram Desktop through https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-one/

Once installed, open the file "GeoGreen.nb" with Wolfram Desktop as a Wolfram Notebook.

In the top bar, go to Evaluation>Evaluate Notebook and it should evaluate every cell (which has our code) in the notebook.

The map should display at the bottom of the Texas A&M Campus and its recycling bin locations, along with tooltips upon clicking the icons.

Thanks and Gig 'Em!
